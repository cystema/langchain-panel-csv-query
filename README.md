# 📊 CSV Explorer with LangChain & HoloViz Panel

CSV Explorer is a powerful web-based application that allows users to interact with CSV data in a conversational manner using LangChain and visualize data correlations using HoloViz Panel and Plotly. This tool leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI to understand natural language queries and extract insights from your datasets.

## ✨ Features

- Natural Language Interaction: Query your CSV data with natural language questions like “What is the correlation between X and Y?” or “Show me the rows where value A is greater than B.”
- Dynamic Data Visualization: Instantly generate interactive plots (scatter, line, bar, etc.) to visualize correlations and relationships between values.
- Real-time Insights: Get immediate responses with insights, visualizations, and correlations by asking questions in plain English.
- Chat-based Interface: A chatbox interface that allows easy interaction and exploration of your data.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- LangChain: Facilitates the use of large language models (LLMs) for processing natural language queries and interacting with data.
- HoloViz Panel: Provides a highly interactive and responsive UI for visualizing data and managing user inputs.
- Plotly: Used for rendering dynamic and interactive visualizations directly from your data.
- Pandas: Powers the backend for data manipulation and processing.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5: Serves as the LLM for parsing natural language and generating data-driven insights.
